# Python3-Bacics
Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in early 1990’s and its latest version is 3.6, we can simply call it as Python3. Python 3.0 was released in 2008.
# Print
In python3 t print any line we use 'print("<text>")'.
# Variables
n other programming languages like C, C++ and Java, you will need to declare the type of variables but in Python you don’t need to do that. Just type in the variable and when values will be given to it, then it will automatically know whether the value given would be a int, float or char or even a String.
