# Python3-Bacics
Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in early 1990’s and its latest version is 3.6, we can simply call it as Python3. Python 3.0 was released in 2008.
# Print
In python3 t print any line we use 'print("<text>")'.
# Variables
n other programming languages like C, C++ and Java, you will need to declare the type of variables but in Python you don’t need to do that. Just type in the variable and when values will be given to it, then it will automatically know whether the value given would be a int, float or char or even a String.
# Listing
  List is the most basic Data Structure in python. List is mutable data structure it means items can be added to list later after the list creation. Its like you are going to shop at local market and made a list of some items and later on you can add more and more items to the list.append() function is used to add data to the list.
# Input/Output
  input() function is used to take input from the user.
  print() functiom is used to give output.
# Selection
  In python selection is made using 'if' and 'elif'(here we use elif on the place of elseif).
# Functions
  you can think of functions like a bunch of code that is intended to do a particular task in the whole Python script. Python   used the keyword ‘def’ to define a function.
# For loop
  For loops can iterate over a sequence of numbers using the "range" and "xrange" functions. The difference between range and   xrange is that the range function returns a new list with numbers of that specified range, whereas xrange returns an           iterator, which is more efficient.
# While loop
  While loop repeat as long as a certain bollean condition is met.
# Break/Continue
  break is used to exit a for loop or a while loop, whereas continue is used to skip the current block, and return to the       "for" or "while" statement.
# Modules
  Python has a very rich module library that has several functions to do many tasks. 'import’ keyword is used to import a       particular module into your python code. 
# Binary Operations
  
  Operator      Operation                           Example
  **            Exponent                            2 ** 2 = 8
  %             Modules/remainder                   22 % 8= 6
  //            Integer division/floored quotient   22 //8 = 2
  /             Division                            22 / 8 = 2.75
  *             Multiplication                      2 * 5 = 10
  -             Subtraction                         5 - 3 = 2
  +             Addition                            7 + 3 = 10
